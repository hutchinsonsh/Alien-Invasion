# Alien-Invasion
My first attempt at game making back in freshman year when I still had free time. Also my first major project using python. It turned out half-decent. 

I took some liberties with how the player moved mostly because I wanted to work on coding for when a player moves in all
directions. I did the same with the bullets that can be fired for the same reason. I also added in a bonus round 
in order to learn how to code more randomized npcs.
